Busy consumers don't have the time or inclination to cook. They want the flavor of fresh bread without the hassle of baking. They want tasty, nutritious meals without dishes to wash. In fact, the rise in popularity of to-go operations underscores some clear trends in the food-service industry. More and more singles, working parents and elderly people are demanding greater convenience when it comes to buying their meals.\nNew York City's food culture includes an array of international cuisines influenced by the city's immigrant history. For e.g.<u> Central and Eastern European immigrants, especially Jewish immigrants from those regions</u>, brought bagels, cheesecake, hot dogs, knishes, and delicatessens (or delis) to the city.\n<u>Italian immigrants</u> brought New York-style pizza and Italian cuisine into the city, while Jewish immigrants and Irish immigrants brought pastrami and corned beef, respectively.\n<u>Indian restaurants</u> have introduced the traditional Indian spices used in their most of the preprations.\nChinese and other Asian restaurants, sandwich joints, trattorias, diners, and coffeehouses are ubiquitous throughout the city. Some 4,000 mobile food vendors licensed by the city, many immigrant-owned, have made Middle Eastern foods such as falafel and kebabs.\n\nThough the future looks bright for the food-service industry overall, there are no guarantees in this business. Even the most successful operators will tell you this isn't a \"get rich quick\" industry. \n\nSince we now know that we have a lot of competitors in the market.
